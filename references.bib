ABSTRACT = {The paper deals with the locations of IP addresses that were used in the past. This retrospective geolocation suffers from continuous changes in the Internet space and a limited availability of past IP location databases. I analyse the retrospective geolocation of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses over five years. An approach is also introduced to handle missing past IP geolocation databases. The results show that it is safe to retrospectively locate IP addresses by a couple of years, but there are differences between IPv4 and IPv6. The described parametric model of location lifetime allows us to estimate the time when the address location changed in the past. The retrospective geolocation of IP addresses has a broad range of applications, including social studies, system analyses, and security investigations. Two longitudinal use cases with the applied results are discussed. The first deals with geotargeted online content. The second deals with identity theft prevention in e-commerce.},

abstract = {The exponential growth of the Internet interconnections has led to a significant growth of cyber attack incidents often with disastrous and grievous consequences. Malware is the primary choice of weapon to carry out malicious intents in the cyberspace, either by exploitation into existing vulnerabilities or utilization of unique characteristics of emerging technologies. The development of more innovative and effective malware defense mechanisms has been regarded as an urgent requirement in the cybersecurity community. To assist in achieving this goal, we first present an overview of the most exploited vulnerabilities in existing hardware, software, and network layers. This is followed by critiques of existing state-of-the-art mitigation techniques as why they do or don't work. We then discuss new attack patterns in emerging technologies such as social media, cloud computing, smartphone technology, and critical infrastructure. Finally, we describe our speculative observations on future research directions.}

abstract = {Many companies have cited lack of cyber-security as the main barrier to Industrie 4.0 or digitalization. Security functions include protection, detection, response and investigation. Cyber-attack investigation is important as it can support the mitigation of damages and maturing future prevention approaches. Nowadays, the investigation of cyber-attacks has evolved more than ever leveraging combinations of intelligent tools and digital forensics processes. Intelligent tools (e.g., YARA rules and Indicators of Compromise) are effective only when there is prior knowledge about software and mechanisms used in the cyber-attack, i.e., they are not attack-agnostic. Therefore, the effectiveness of these intelligent tools is inversely proportional to the number of the never-seen-before software and mechanisms utilized. Digital forensic processes, while not suffering from such issue, lack the ability to provide in-depth support to a cyber-attack investigation mainly due to insufficient detailed instructions in the examination and analysis phases. This paper proposes a digital forensics framework for reviewing and investigating cyber-attacks, called D4I, which focuses on enhancing the examination and analysis phases. First, the framework proposes a digital artifacts categorization and mapping to the Cyber-Kill-Chain steps of attacks. Second, it provides detailed instructing steps for the examination and analysis phases. The applicability of D4I is demonstrated with an application example that concerns a typical case of a spear phishing attack.}

 abstract = {Publishing and sharing data is critical to fostering collaboration and advancing scientific research. Data portals are commonly used to organize, publish, and securely disseminate data—a critical step toward making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). However, the diversity of scientific data types, sizes, and their location present significant challenges, e.g., it is difficult for portals to accommodate heterogenous research products when using strict metadata schemas and rigid interfaces. Thus, there is a need for a user-customizable data portal solution that enables rapid creation of new portals that may be tailored to a researchers needs while accommodating distributed data sources and engaging advanced computing resources. In this paper, we present the Django Globus Portal Framework (DGPF), a tool designed to help users rapidly create secure, customizable, and extensible data portals. DGPF is a powerful and flexible framework that builds upon the Globus platform for authentication, data sharing, creation of automation flows, and search capabilities, allowing for seamless integration with existing research workflows. We present the design and implementation of the DGPF and describe our experiences operating the Argonne Community Data Co-op (ACDC)—a collection of DGPF portals with over 1 M records and over 100 TB of published data that has been accessed by more than 300 users.},
